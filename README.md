9:40AM
I need a script that will mimic the steps we take to log into a website with the user credentials and do a batch upload of a .csv file and then log out.

I will need to duplicate this process 30 times for 30 different user accounts so in addition to the script I need the ability to know where to edit the script to substitute:

1. Different user name and login credentials
2. Different location for the source file

I have an example video I can send to qualified candidates showing all the steps which are:

Step 1: Go to a URL and click Login
Step 2: Login in with user name and password
Step 3: Choose "My Listings" and batch listing upload
Step 4: Click "Upload file"
Step 5: Choose File from Source Destination provided
Step 6: Click to confirm upload
Step 7: Sign out

Est. Budget: $44.44

Milestone 1: Python Script for Logging in and doing Simple Upload

Due: Wednesday, June 28, 2023

Amount in escrow: $44.44

Austin - I've sent you the offer on this. I am also sending you a video and the logins for five different accounts. Please treat all of this confidentially. I want to be able to deploy this one user at a time. I know that's not the most efficient, but it's best based for me. Thus, the script will need to be something that I can just change out and I'll figure out how to deploy, etc. Here are the items you will need:

Here's what you need in terms of files: Video showing exact process with overview. Logins and sample files. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else. If this goes well, I have multiple jobs I would like to work with you to complete that are very similar to this.
